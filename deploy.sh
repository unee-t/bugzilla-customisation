# This script is created to deploy the BZFE
#
# We needs several variables that are maintained in different places:
#	- Variables stored in the Travis CI "Settings":
#	  These are needed so that automated deployment are working as intended
#		- AWS_DEFAULT_REGION <--- This is probably overkill since we have this in aws-env.[stage] variables
#		- PROFILE_DEV
#		- PROFILE_PROD
#		- PROFILE_DEMO
#
#	- Variables stored in the aws-env.[stage] file
#		- STAGE
#		- PROFILE
#		- AWS_REGION
#
#	- Variables need to be set when 
#		- Option 1: .travis.yml is called.
#		- Option 2: when deploy.sh is called
#
# To run this script, run this command: `./deploy.sh -[STAGE]`
# where STAGE is either
#	- `dev` for the DEV environment
#	- `prod` for the PROD environment
#	- `demo` for the DEMO environment

# Step 1: Setup the parameters and variables we need:

set -e
